- for this problem I used the merge sort algorithm to sort the input list.
### time complexity
- the solution uses merge sort that has a time complexity of o(nlog(n)) where n in the size of the input list.
### space complexity 
- the space complexity is o(n) as the merge sort needs to create a new array that will contain the sorted numbers.
