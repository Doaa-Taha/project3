- for this problem I used the binary search algorithm to find the floored square root of an input number.
### time complexity
- the solution uses binary search that has a time complexity of o(log(n)) where n in the input number.
### space complexity 
- the space complexity is o(1) which means it's conatant and doesn't depend on the input number.
