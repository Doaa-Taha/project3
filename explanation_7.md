### time complexity
- the time complexity of the insert method of the RouteTrieNode class is O(1)
- the time complexity of the insert and find methods of the RouteTrie class is O(n) where n is the number of parts in the path.

### space complexity
- the space complexity of the trie is O(n) where n is the number of the unique parts in the path.
