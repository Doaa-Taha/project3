- for this problem I used the binary search algorithm to find the index of a number by searching in a rotated sorted array
### time complexity
- the solution uses binary search that has a time complexity of o(log(n)) where n in the lenght of the array.
### space complexity 
- the space complexity is o(1) which means it's conatant and doesn't depend on the input number.
