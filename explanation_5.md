### time complexity
- The time complexity for inserting a word is O(n) where n is the length of the word.
- The time complexity for finding a prefix is O(n) where n is the length of the prefix.
- The time complexity for collecting the suffixes is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the word.
### space complexity 
- The space complexity for inserting a word is O(n) where n is the length of the word as we might need to create up to n nodes in worst case scenario.
- The space complexity for finding a prefix is O(1) as we don't need any extra space to be created.
